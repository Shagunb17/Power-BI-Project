# Power-BI-Project
Sales Analysis Project Using SQL and Power BI

Conducted comprehensive sales analysis using SQL for data extraction and Power BI for interactive visualization, focusing on revenue, profitability, customer spending, and store performance.
Employed Power Query to standardize date formats and adjust data types, enabling consistent data processing. Utilized DAX functions to create custom measures, supporting detailed analysis across metrics.
Built interactive dashboards with slicers for filtering by region, store type, age group, product, and date, allowing flexible data exploration.
Highlighted top-performing products (top 3 by revenue/profit), high-spending customers (top 5), and store profitability by region and store type. Analyzed sales and returns by product and identified inactive customers (no purchase in 90 days).
Leveraged a variety of visuals, including tables, bar charts, pie charts, and KPI cards, with conditional formatting and tooltips for enhanced insights, leading to actionable recommendations in marketing and operations.
